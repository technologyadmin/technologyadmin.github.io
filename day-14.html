        <h2 class="article-title">Jesus is king</h2>
        <q class="intro-verse">On his robe and on his thigh, he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.</q>
        <p class="intro-verse reference">&mdash;Revelation 19:16</p>
        <p>My son-in-law told my four-year-old granddaughter, Sully, to stop doing something the other day, when she looked at him and promptly said, “You can’t tell me what to do!  You’re not the king of me, Jesus is king!”</p>
        <p>Then she turned to my daughter and, under her breath, asked, “Now, remind me who the queen is again?”</p>
        <p>Bless her heart, her theology is getting there, but she nailed the most important part: Jesus is king!</p>
        <p>That’s why the angels were so excited to share the good news of great joy with the shepherds that first Christmas night. The King of Heaven had humbled himself as a man and came to earth to sacrifice himself for our salvation.</p>
        <p>What does it mean to be a king?</p>
        <p>Well, bottom line, it means he is sovereign. The king is the supreme ruler, in charge, and in control. Not only was Jesus the king at his birth, but later, when he died on the cross and rose again, he conquered death, and, to this day, sits at the right hand of the Father.</p>
        <p>Jesus is still king! Wow, that’s still good news isn’t it!</p>
        <p>As we celebrate this very weird, wacky, Christmas of 2020, we need to keep this magnificent truth in mind. I know this year we’ve all been stunned and anxiously looking at the news stories each night. We’ve seen many of our cities on fire, violence in the streets, everyone wearing masks, businesses going under left and right, kids not allowed to physically attend school, many moms having to teach their kids at home while working and still taking care of the house, and not to mention the fear of getting sick from the COVID-19 virus that is the reason for the pandemic.</p>
        <p>Wow, that’s a lot to be anxious about, but let’s all remember that Jesus is still king! He is still sovereign and none of this shocked or surprised him.</p>
        <p>And because he is still in charge, that means we can place our trust in him. Boy, Proverbs 3:5–6 was penned a long, long time ago, but is so true for us today when it was written: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.”</p>
        <p>Even in a season like this, we trust in him. When things seem to be out of control, we trust in him. When fear seems to be a constant in our families, we trust in him. Why?</p>
        <p>Because Jesus is king!</p>
        <p>And it doesn’t matter who the queen is!</p>

        <ol>
            <li>How can we show in our daily lives that we trust in Jesus?</li>
            <li>Why do you think it’s so important to acknowledge him in all our ways?</li>
